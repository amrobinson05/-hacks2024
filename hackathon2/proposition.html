        <h1>What is SNAP and Why is it important?</h1>
        <p>SNAP (Supplemental  Nutrition Assistance Program) is a federal assistance program designed to provide 
            nutritional support to low-income individuals and families. We believe it is important to push for 
            the acceptance of SNAP at farmers markets and expand the number of markets because access to fresh,
            locally grown produce should be accessible to all. This idea matches the goal of the SNAP program
            and has been adopted by a number of markets across Virginia. 
        </p>
        
        <h1>Why Farmers' Markets?</h1>
        <p>Unlike typical grocery stores, farmers markets provide a space where local farmers, artisans, and consumers
            interact directly, fostering a sense of community, trust, and shared purpose. The produce is higher
            quality and locally grown, making it ideal for a healthy lifestyle. Expanding SNAP acceptance at markets
            supports food security, enhances accessibility to healthir foods, and contributes to the fight against the 
            poverty-obesity cycle by empowering lower-income individuals to make nutritious food choices.
        </p>

        <h1> Example Target Areas</h1>
        <p>These areas are examples of counties that would be good candidates for SNAP accepting markets
            <ul>
                <li>Buchanan County: 20% SNAP eligible; No current USDA registered markets; obesity rate of 40.5%</li>
                <li>Charlotte County: 16% SNAP eligible; No current USDA registered markets; obesity rate of 42.4% </li>
                <li>Sussex County: 42.3% SNAP eligible; No current USDA regisitered markets; obesity rate 42.3%</li>
              </ul>
              While expanding accessibility to farmers markets will not solve the poverty-obesity cycle alone, we believe 
              it is a step in the right direction.
